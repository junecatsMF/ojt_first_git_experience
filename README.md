README file is a textfile where you can read your file in Github. 
README is a plain text or Markdown file (usually named README.md) that provides information about a project. Explain what the project is about and sow how to install or use the project. It list features, requirements, or contributions guidelines.
In my understanding, README is a file that gives people the idea of what does your project do what what it is all about.
