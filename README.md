A README file is a textfile in that contains an important information such as license or a instruction on what is needed to be done before doing something also a README file must be included in every file u must create to instruct the person who downloaded it.

In addition ive learned that READ ME file is a text file that will tell us about what is the repository is about or what is the file about. It must be present in all type of repository to guide the people who wants to clone and copy your file
