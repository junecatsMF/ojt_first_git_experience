README file is a file that contains either an instruction or a license of the projects which you will be needing since youll be posting ur repo publicly in the github.

A README file is a text file (usually named README.md) that contains important information about a project. Itâ€™s often the first thing people see when they visit a code repository (like on GitHub).
Think of it as a user manual or introduction to your project.

Ive learned that README file is a text file that has full of intructions or license from the owner of the file, Also it has important informations on what is the file about.
